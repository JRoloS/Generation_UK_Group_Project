## Description 

<div style="text-align: justify">
Introducing the Brewed-Awakening Project - an innovative solution that will revolutionize the way Super-Cafe manages its sales data.

As Super-Cafe continues to expand across the country, their sales data has been increasing exponentially, leading to an urgent need for an efficient and effective data management system. The current system of using Comma Separated Values format for tracking data has become outdated and unreliable, leading to a lot of manual work and errors.

With the Brewed-Awakening Project, our team will be creating a state-of-the-art software solution that will meet all of Super-Cafe's data management needs. We aim to deliver a fully functional product by the end of Week 5 that will be ready for testing. Our software will feature core functionality that will help Super-Cafe expertly and efficiently organize its data, leading to improved sales in the long run.

During Week 6, we will focus on refining and polishing the code while adding any new non-essential functions. Our ultimate goal is to provide Super-Cafe with a comprehensive solution that is easy to use and maintain, so they can focus on growing their business domestically and internationally. With our software in place, Super-Cafe will have a competitive edge over its competitors, allowing it to dominate the market and become a leader in the industry.

<!-- Our client Super-Cafe have experienced unprecedented growth over the last few months and have thus expanded to multiple branches nationwide. 
However with this growth has come a fair amount of sales data inflowing into their systems. 
Their old method of using Comma Separated Values format for tracking their data is outdated and needs an upgrade to keep up with demand.
This is where the Brewed-Awakening Project comes into play.
Our project by the end of Week 5 will have a finished product in the demo phase, ready to be tested which will fulfill all requirements. 
This product will have core functionality and we will use week 6 to improve and polish the code whilst adding any new non-essential functions. 
By this our client, Super-Cafe, will be able to expertly and efficiently organise their data which will improve sales in the long run leading to further growth internationally. -->
