## Description 

Introducing the Brewed-Awakening Project - an innovative solution that will revolutionize the way Super-Cafe manages its sales data.

As Super-Cafe continues to expand across the country, their sales data has been increasing exponentially, leading to an urgent need for an efficient and effective data management system. The current system of using Comma Separated Values format for tracking data has become outdated and unreliable, leading to a lot of manual work and errors.

With the Brewed-Awakening Project, our team will be creating a state-of-the-art software solution that will meet all of Super-Cafe's data management needs. We aim to deliver a fully functional product by the end of Week 5 that will be ready for testing. Our software will feature core functionality that will help Super-Cafe expertly and efficiently organize its data, leading to improved sales in the long run.

During Week 6, we will focus on refining and polishing the code while adding any new non-essential functions. Our ultimate goal is to provide Super-Cafe with a comprehensive solution that is easy to use and maintain, so they can focus on growing their business domestically and internationally. With our software in place, Super-Cafe will have a competitive edge over its competitors, allowing it to dominate the market and become a leader in the industry.

## Configuration

This section provides information on how to customize the project to meet the specific needs. This section may include details on how to modify settings, configure options, or adjust parameters to optimize the project. By providing clear and concise instructions on how to configure the project, we can help users get the most out of the software and ensure that it meets their unique requirements.


### **Setting up the local Database for testing**

* Choose a database management system (DBMS) e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL.
* Install the DBMS on your computer. For the Brewed Awakening Project we have chosen to use Adminer SQL for our local testing. [Why?](#why-adminer-sql)
* Time to spin-up the docker container on your local testing machine, first change your directory into the "docker_setup" folder, then run this command:
```
docker compose up -d 
```
* You should then see a docker container ready with two sub containers for the GUI for adminer(8080:8080) and for the internal PostgreSQL database(5432:5432).

* You can then navigate to http://localhost:8080 to log in and interact with your database.


### **Configuring the Database connection**

To configure the database connection using Adminer SQL, you'll need to follow these steps:

* Open your web browser and navigate to the Adminer SQL login page.
* Change the "system" tab from `MYSQL` to `PostgreSQL`. 
* Enter the database server hostname, port number, username, and password (same used in the `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files).
* Click the "Login" button to log in to the database server.

Once you've logged in to the database server, you should be able to create, edit, and delete databases and tables using the Adminer SQL interface.

* The quickest and easiest way to set-up our exact database schema would involve finding the `import` button in the main select database page. 
* Once on the import page, click `choose files`, navigate to the same directory the local repository is located and find the `BA-Final-Schema.sql` file and upload. 
* Lastly, click `Execute` to create all tables and foreign key constraints instantly, you should end up with the schema below.

### **Database Schema**

### **Customising the Data Schema**

Super-Cafe's data schema can be customized to meet your specific needs. To do this, you'll need to modify the database tables using Adminer SQL. Here's how to add or remove tables and modify the data types of existing fields:



#### **Adding a Table**

To add a new table to the database, follow these steps:

* Log in to the database server using Adminer SQL.
* Click the "SQL command" button to open the SQL command prompt.
* Enter the SQL command to create the new table.
* For example, to create a new table called `orders` with the fields `order_id`, `customer_id`, and `order_date`, you would enter the following SQL command:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
     order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
     customer_id INT,
     order_date DATE
   );
   ```
Here are some other SQL commands to follow

#### **Removing a Table**

```sql
DROP TABLE orders;
```

#### **Adding a One-to-Many Relationship**

To add a one-to-many relationship between two tables in the database, follow these steps:

* Log in to the database server using Adminer SQL.
* Click the "SQL command" button to open the SQL command prompt.
* Enter the SQL command to add a foreign key constraint to the child table.
* For example, to create a one-to-many relationship between the `orders` and `customers` tables using the `customer_id` field, you would enter the following SQL command:
   
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE orders
   ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customers
   FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
   REFERENCES customers(customer_id);
   ```
### **Cloud Architecture**

<p align="center"><img src="Documentation/Cloud Architecture.png"/></p>

## ETL Pipeline CloudFormation Setup

This section will walk you through the steps required to set up the ETL pipeline environment in AWS using the provided CloudFormation template in the infra folder. The pipeline assumes that you already have an S3 bucket containing the CSV files that will be processed by the pipeline.

### **Prerequisites**

Before starting, make sure you have the following:
* An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create and manage resources
* The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured on your local machine

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository containing the ETL pipeline code to your local machine:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

Change into the repository directory:

```
cd <repository_directory>
```

### **Step 2: Update Configuration**

Open the CloudFormation YAML file saved in the "infra" folder and update the following parameters:
* BucketNameRawData: Enter the name of the S3 bucket you wish to create or use for the pipeline
* VpcSubnetId: Provide the ID of the Redshift private subnet in your VPC
* SecurityGroupId: Provide the ID of the Redshift security group

Save the changes to the yaml file

### **Step 3: Deploy the CloudFormation Stack**

In your terminal, navigate to the repository directory (if not already there)

Deploy the CloudFormation stack using the AWS CLI:

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <stack_name> --template-body file://template.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

Replace <stack_name> with a unique name for your CloudFormation stack

Wait for the stack creation to complete. You can monitor the progress in the AWS CloudFormation console or by running the following command:

```
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <stack_name> --query "Stacks[0].StackStatus"
```

Once the stack status is CREATE_COMPLETE, the environment has been successfully set up

### **Step 4: Verify Lambda Trigger**

Once the CSV files are uploaded to the S3 bucket, the Lambda function will be triggered automatically for each new file created

You can verify the trigger by checking the AWS Lambda console or by viewing the function's logs

For more information on managing AWS CloudFormation stacks, refer to the [AWS CloudFormation documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/index.html)


### **Executing deployment files**

To deploy changes from your current local branch into AWS you can use the following steps:

```
./deploy_aws_windows.sh <profile-name> # For windows systems

./deploy_aws_unix.sh <profile-name> # For unix systems
```

## Why Adminer SQL?

There are several benefits to using Adminer SQL as a database management tool:

* Lightweight: Adminer SQL is a lightweight tool that can be easily installed and used on most systems. It has a small memory footprint and can be run on low-resource systems.
* User-friendly interface: Adminer SQL provides a user-friendly web-based interface that makes it easy to manage databases, run queries, and perform other database-related tasks. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, even for users who are not familiar with SQL.
* Multi-database support: Adminer SQL supports several popular database management systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used across a variety of projects and applications.
* Customization: Adminer SQL is highly customizable and can be extended with plugins and themes. This allows users to tailor the tool to their specific needs and preferences.

We preferred to use Adminer SQL for our Brewed Awakening project, over other database management tools for these reasons. Additionally, because it is open source software, it is free to use and can be customized to meet specific needs. Its user-friendly interface and support for multiple database systems make it a popular choice for developers.
