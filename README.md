## Description 

Our client Super-Cafe have experienced unprecedented growth over the last few months and have thus expanded to multiple branches nationwide. 

However with this growth has come alot more sales data inflowing into their systems. 

Their old method of using Comma Seperated Values format for tracking their data is outdated and needs an upgrade to keep up with demand.

This is where the Brewed-Awakening Project comes into play.

Our project by the end of Week 5 will have a finished product in the demo phase, ready to be tested which will fulfill all requirements. 

This product will have core functionality and we will use week 6 to improve and polish the code whilst adding any new non-essential functions. 

By this our client, Super-Cafe, will be able to expertly and efficiently organise their data which will improve sales in the long run leading to further growth internationally.
